Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women, and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most common form of breast cancer. Accurately identifying and categorizing breast cancer subtypes is an important clinical task, and automated methods can be used to save time and reduce errors.

Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) is the most common subtype of all breast cancers. Pathologists typically focus on the regions containing the IDC to assign an aggressiveness grade to a whole mount sample. As a result, one of the common pre-processing steps for automatic aggressiveness grading is to delineate the exact areas of IDC inside of a whole mount slide.

The most common kinds of breast cancer are—

Invasive ductal carcinoma. The cancer cells begin in the ducts and then grow outside the ducts into other parts of the breast tissue. Invasive cancer cells can also spread, or metastasize, to other parts of the body.
Invasive lobular carcinoma. Cancer cells begin in the lobules and then spread from the lobules to the breast tissues that are close by. These invasive cancer cells can also spread to other parts of the body.


This project depends on two datasets: The first Dataset is cbis-ddsm-breast-cancer-image-dataset from. the second Dataset is breast-histopathology-images. Its been said to have 0.96 efficiency

A risk factor is anything that increases your chances of getting a disease, such as cancer. But having a risk factor, or even many, does not mean that you are sure to get the disease. While you can’t change some breast cancer risk factors—family history and aging, for example—there are some risk factors that you can control.

The screening sensitivity, transition probability of the disease, and mean sojourn time were all found to increase with age. For the 40–49 year old and 50–59 year old cohorts, the posterior mean sensitivities were 0.70 (95% HPD-CI: 0.46, 0.93) and 0.77 (0.61, 0.93), respectively. The posterior mean transition probabilities were 0.0023 (0.0018, 0.0027) and 0.0031 (0.0024, 0.0038), while the posterior mean sojourn times were 2.55 (1.56, 4.26) years and 3.15 (2.12, 4.96) years. Bayes factors for the ratio of posterior probabilities that the respective parameter was larger vs. smaller in the 50–59 year old cohort were estimated to be 2.09, 40.8 and 3.0 for the sensitivity, transition probability, and mean sojourn time, respectively. All three Bayes factors were larger than two, indicating greater than 2:1 odds in favor of the hypothesis that each of these parameters was greater in the 50–59 year old cohort. The estimated mean lead times were 0.83 years and 0.96 years if the two cohorts were screened annually.
